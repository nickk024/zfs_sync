## Technical Considerations
- Python for the main application
- Textual for TUI framework
- Paramiko for SSH operations
- Integration with existing sanoid/syncoid tools
- ZFS command-line tools integration

## Deployment Instructions

### Production Server Setup
1. Ensure the production server has the following prerequisites:
   - Python 3.7 or higher
   - ZFS filesystem
   - SSH server configured
   - Git (for cloning the repository)

2. Clone the repository to the production server:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zfs_sync.git
   cd zfs_sync
   ```

3. Run the comprehensive test script to verify the environment:
   ```
   chmod +x test.sh
   ./test.sh
   ```

4. Run the setup to initialize the environment:
   ```
   ./start.sh --setup
   ```

5. Configure sanoid:
   - Edit the sanoid configuration file at `~/.zfs_sync/sanoid.conf`
   - Set up appropriate snapshot retention policies
   - Configure datasets to be managed by sanoid

6. Start the application:
   ```
   ./start.sh
   ```

### Job Management
1. Create a job for synchronizing your media:
   ```
   ./start.sh --create-job media_sync
   ```

2. Edit the job to configure:
   ```
   ./start.sh --edit-job media_sync
   ```
   - Source dataset (tank/media)
   - Destination server and dataset
   - Synchronization options

3. Run the job:
   ```
   ./start.sh --run-job media_sync
   ```
   - This may take a long time depending on the dataset size
   - The first sync will be a full backup
   - Subsequent syncs will be incremental

4. Schedule the job for regular execution:
   ```
   ./start.sh --schedule-job media_sync
   ```
   - Enter the cron schedule (e.g., 0 2 * * * for 2:00 AM daily)

5. Verify the scheduled jobs:
   ```
   ./start.sh --list-schedules
   ```

### Ongoing Maintenance
1. Monitor logs for any issues:
   - Check `~/.zfs_sync/logs/` for application logs
   - Review ZFS and sanoid logs for any filesystem issues

2. Perform regular backups of the configuration:
   ```
   cp -r ~/.zfs_sync /path/to/backup/location
   ```

3. Run the test script periodically to verify the system:
   ```
   ./test.sh
   ```
